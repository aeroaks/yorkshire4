The last major stronghold of Robot forces outside the U.R.S* is hidden in
ancient castle ruins in the middle of the desert. A fleets of desert 
hovertanks has been sent to destroy it and you are the commander. Your
tank controls the five remaining missiles.

You must assess carefully the direction and elevation before you launch
each one. Your computer will ask you for a direction angle between -90째
(extreme left) and +90째 (extreme right) and an elevation angle between 0째
(along the ground) and 90째 (straight up). The elevation determine the 
distance the missile will travel.
